=====================

Simple game for arduino with LinkSprite LCD 16x2 display. I created this for my nephews to be a simple project they can play around with and modify when they come visit.
<br><br>
The game first shows a "splash screen" with some text. Then has a "menu mode" where a player can select a difficulty setting. Then a "game mode" where a player can "win" or "lose" the game.
<br><br>
The game itself displays a player's character that can be moved from one line to the other on the LCD screen. The object is to dodge the obstacles that come toward the player. (sample video coming soon)
